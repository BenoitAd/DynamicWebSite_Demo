# DynamicWebSite_Demo
This project aims to demonstrate my ability to create a dynamic and interactive e-commerce website, featuring a product collection with a carousel display and individual product pages. The site will showcase my skills in PHP for server-side scripting, allowing me to dynamically generate HTML content based on database data.
